# Introduction

Purpose of this application is to track time. If you are working in the company where they pay you overtimes, the this application can help you to track how much time have you worked and how much hours you should charge in company tools.

I started to track my time in Excel file, however this was not an ideal scenario, especially when I worked some hours in the office and then some more hours from home. So I decided to create an Apex application which would solve some issues I had with the tracking.
