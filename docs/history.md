# History

The following sections explain my motivations behind application creation.

## Version 1

In the past I've used an Excel file created by one of my colleague which looked like this:

Each time I had to hit start/stop button to mark time when I started to work and when I finished work that day. This approach of course had some gaps, i.e. if I would like to track in more detail on which task I spent how much time, I had to mark this in some other column. The same situation was causing issues when I worked some hours in the office and then some more hours from the home.

## Version 2

After several years of using this Excel application I decided to create new application. Since I'm an Oracle developer and huge fan Oracle APEX, the decision was to use Apex for this. At the time I hosted application on apex.oracle.com:

## Version 3

Application build in APEX was much more mature compared to Excel, however I still had to hit two buttons to track start and stop for the task. Sometimes it was not productive enough and it was not possible to track time for more users. Third version of personal time tracking application was created.

## Version 4

Version 3 was redesigned little bit to be more user friendly. In this version I also tried to minimize "custom" development as much as possible and to leverage cards out of the box functionalities.
